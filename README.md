## Tech Stack

This search experience is powered by [Typesense](https://typesense.org), an open-source, typo-tolerant search engine. It's designed as a faster alternative to Elasticsearch and an open-source alternative to Algolia.

The frontend is built with:
- [InstantSearch.js](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js)
- [Typesense Instantsearch Adapter](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter)
- Bootstrap 4
- Parcel bundler

The search backend runs on Typesense, which can be self-hosted or used via [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org).
